            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello Recruiters! I'm Rayhan, a Data Scientist/ML Engineer with nearly 4 years of experience. I've had the privilege of working at different businesses and different scale companies. I have the experience at working with big corporation like <strong>Freeport Mcmoran ($29B Market cap) </strong>, a unicorn startup like <strong>Finaccel (also one of the biggest fintech in Indonesia)</strong>, and a small early startup like <strong>Fairphonic</strong>. I've done a lot of works ranging from analyzing mining production bottlenecks, determine best calculation window for credit scoring, to building perceptual music similarity retrieval model. This page just brushes the surface of what I did, for more detailed explanation please refer to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5OKWP76Z6Ntmm6zTBS5KcOOJdMQo98n/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">my resume</a>. </p>
